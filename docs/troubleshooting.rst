--------------------------------

This is a bit of a rabbit hole, but it's due to an interaction between
terminals and tmux and nvim.

`This gist <https://gist.github.com/bbqtd/a4ac060d6f6b9ea6fe3aabe735aa9d95>`_
has a nice writeup and description of the fix.

For Alacritty, see `this gist
<https://gist.github.com/andersevenrud/015e61af2fd264371032763d4ed965b6>`_,
which also includes a setting you need in
:file:`.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml`.
